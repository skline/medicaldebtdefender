Medical bills can often be confusing and overwhelming. Understanding the intricacies of medical billing is crucial when it comes to disputing and appealing charges. In this article, we will explore various strategies and tips to help you navigate the process of appealing medical bills successfully.
Understanding Medical Billing: A Primer
Before delving into the appeal process, it is essential to have a basic understanding of how medical billing works. Your medical bill consists of numerous components, including:
1.	Services rendered
2.	Medical codes
3.	Insurance coverage
4.	Out-of-pocket expenses
Each of these elements plays a vital role in determining the total amount billed to you. Familiarizing yourself with these details will help you decipher your medical bill accurately.
When it comes to services rendered, it encompasses all the medical procedures, tests, and treatments you received during your visit. From routine check-ups to complex surgeries, each service has a specific cost associated with it.
Medical codes, also known as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, are alphanumeric codes that describe the medical procedures and services provided. These codes are used by healthcare providers to communicate with insurance companies and ensure accurate billing.
Insurance coverage is another crucial aspect of medical billing. Depending on your insurance plan, certain services may be covered partially or in full. Understanding the terms and conditions of your insurance policy will help you determine the extent to which your medical expenses will be reimbursed.
Out-of-pocket expenses refer to the portion of the medical bill that you are responsible for paying. This includes deductibles, co-pays, and any services not covered by your insurance plan. It is important to consider these expenses when budgeting for healthcare costs.
Decoding Your Medical Bill
To effectively appeal a medical bill, you need to identify any errors or discrepancies. Carefully review your bill and compare it with the services you received. Look for:
•	Duplicate charges
•	Incorrect billing codes
•	Unbundling of services
•	Mistakenly included items
If you spot any inaccuracies, make note of them as they will form the basis of your appeal.
Common Errors in Medical Billing
Medical billing errors are not uncommon, and they can significantly impact the amount you are charged. Some common billing errors include:
•	Incorrect coding: This occurs when the medical provider assigns the wrong code to a procedure, leading to an inflated charge.
•	Upcoding: This involves billing for a higher level of service than what was provided. It is important to ensure that the billed service accurately reflects the care you received.
•	Unbundling: Instead of billing for a bundled service, individual components are charged separately, resulting in a higher total cost. Paying attention to the breakdown of charges can help you identify instances of unbundling.
Being aware of these potential errors will empower you to identify them within your medical bill and take appropriate action. Remember, understanding medical billing is an ongoing process, and staying informed can help you navigate the complexities of healthcare costs.
The Appeal Process: A Step-by-Step Guide
When confronted with a medical bill that seems excessive or incorrect, pursuing an appeal is often the best course of action. Understanding the steps involved in the appeal process can significantly improve your chances of success.
Medical bills can be overwhelming, especially when they are higher than expected or contain errors. However, it's important to remember that you have the right to question and dispute these charges. By following the appeal process, you can take control of your healthcare expenses and potentially save a significant amount of money.
Preparing for the Appeal
Before initiating an appeal, gather and organize all the relevant documents. This step is crucial as it will provide you with a solid foundation for your case. Some of the documents you should include are:
•	Itemized bills: These detailed statements will help you identify any discrepancies or inflated charges.
•	Medical records: Having access to your medical records will allow you to review the services provided and ensure they align with the billed amount.
•	Insurance policy details: Familiarize yourself with your insurance coverage to understand what should be covered and what might require further investigation.
•	Correspondence with healthcare providers and insurance companies: Keep a record of any communication you have had regarding the billing issue. This will help you track the progress of your appeal and provide evidence of your efforts.
Having this information readily available will streamline the appeal process and enable you to present a strong case. It shows that you have done your due diligence and are serious about resolving the issue.
Once you have gathered all the necessary documents, take some time to review them thoroughly. Look for any discrepancies, inaccuracies, or questionable charges. This will help you build a solid argument for your appeal.
Navigating the Appeal Process
One of the essential aspects of a successful appeal is clear and effective communication. When appealing a medical bill, it's important to follow these steps:
•	Follow the billing dispute procedures outlined by your insurance company. Each insurance provider may have specific guidelines and forms that need to be followed. Adhering to these procedures will ensure that your appeal is considered.
•	Submit a formal written appeal, clearly outlining the reasons for your disagreement. Be concise, yet thorough, in explaining why you believe the charges are excessive or incorrect. Provide specific examples and reference the supporting documentation you have gathered.
•	Include supporting documentation, such as medical records and receipts. These documents serve as evidence to support your case. Make sure to highlight any discrepancies or errors you have identified.
•	Engage in open and courteous communication with your insurance company and healthcare provider. Maintain a professional tone throughout your interactions, even if you feel frustrated or overwhelmed. Building a positive rapport can help facilitate a resolution.
By following these steps, you can make a compelling case for a reduction in your medical bill. Remember to keep copies of all the documents you submit and any correspondence you receive. This will help you track the progress of your appeal and provide evidence if further action is required.
It's important to note that the appeal process may take time, and there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome. However, by being proactive and persistent, you increase your chances of resolving the issue in your favor.
Don't hesitate to seek assistance if you feel overwhelmed or unsure about navigating the appeal process. There are organizations and professionals who specialize in medical billing advocacy and can provide guidance and support.

Key Strategies for Successful Medical Bill Appeals
While navigating the appeal process, there are several key strategies that can increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome.
Appealing a medical bill can be a daunting task, but with the right knowledge and approach, you can effectively dispute the charges and potentially save yourself a significant amount of money. In this article, we will explore two key strategies that can help you navigate the appeal process successfully.
Leveraging Medical Coding Knowledge
Understanding medical coding can give you a significant advantage when disputing a medical bill. Research the relevant billing codes and compare them to the services you received. This knowledge will allow you to pinpoint any discrepancies and effectively argue your case.
Medical coding is a complex system used by healthcare providers to translate medical procedures, diagnoses, and treatments into standardized codes. These codes are then used for billing and insurance purposes. By familiarizing yourself with the coding system, you can identify any errors or inconsistencies in the billing process.
For example, let's say you underwent a minor surgical procedure, but the bill includes charges for a more extensive surgery. By understanding the coding system, you can identify this discrepancy and present it as evidence during the appeal process.
Having a basic understanding of medical coding can also help you communicate effectively with your healthcare provider. By using the correct terminology and referencing specific codes, you can demonstrate that you have done your research and are well-informed about the billing process.
Negotiating with Healthcare Providers
When appealing a medical bill, it is essential to maintain open lines of communication with your healthcare provider. Engage in discussions regarding the charges, express your concerns, and negotiate a fair resolution. Often, healthcare providers are willing to work with patients to rectify billing issues.
Approaching your healthcare provider with a calm and respectful attitude can go a long way in resolving billing disputes. Start by contacting the billing department and explaining your concerns. Provide any supporting documentation, such as medical records or insurance statements, to strengthen your case.
During the negotiation process, it is crucial to clearly communicate your expectations and desired outcome. Be prepared to compromise and find a middle ground that is fair for both parties. Remember, healthcare providers want to maintain a positive relationship with their patients and may be willing to adjust the charges if they see that you are reasonable and well-informed.
If you are unable to reach a resolution through direct negotiations, you can also consider involving a patient advocate or seeking assistance from a medical billing advocate. These professionals specialize in navigating the complex world of medical billing and can provide valuable guidance and support during the appeal process.
Successfully appealing a medical bill requires a combination of knowledge, communication, and negotiation skills. By leveraging your understanding of medical coding and engaging in open discussions with your healthcare provider, you can increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. Remember, you have the right to question and dispute any charges that you believe are incorrect or unfair.
Essential Tips for Medical Bill Appeals
Successfully appealing a medical bill requires careful attention to detail and effective communication. Here are some essential tips to keep in mind:
Keeping Organized Records
Meticulously document every step of the appeal process. Keep copies of all correspondence, bills, and medical records. Having organized records will facilitate your case and make it easier to present your argument convincingly.
Communicating Effectively with Insurance Companies
When communicating with your insurance company, be persistent, but maintain a polite and p®rofessional tone. Clearly articulate your concerns and refer to any supporting documentation. By maintaining a cooperative approach, you increase the chances of a successful resolution.
Dealing with Denials and Rejections
While appealing a medical bill, there is a possibility of facing denials or rejections. Understanding the reasons behind these decisions is crucial for formulating an effective response.
Understanding Reasons for Denials
Insurance companies may deny claims for various reasons, including:
•	Lack of medical necessity
•	Policy exclusions
•	Incorrect documentation
By comprehending the specific grounds for denial, you can address them in your appeal and provide additional supporting evidence if necessary.
Responding to Rejections
If your appeal is rejected, you still have options. Consider seeking external assistance, such as contacting a patient advocate or consulting legal advice. These professionals can guide you on further steps to take, ensuring you have exhausted all possible avenues.
Appealing medical bills can be a cumbersome process, but with the right strategies and tips, you can navigate the complexities and maximize your chances of success. By understanding medical billing, diligently preparing for the appeal, and employing effective communication, you can advocate for fair and accurate charges. Remember, persistence and knowledge are key to achieving a favorable outcome.
Medical debt is surprisingly common and can have far-reaching economic effects. This report explores how medical debt occurs. A companion report looks at the estimated prevalence of medical debt in Tennessee and explains why it matters. Future reports will focus on how medical debt varies across Tennessee’s 95 counties and options for policymakers who want to address it. Figure 1. How a Medical Bill Becomes Medical Debt Source: Adapted from Urban Institute (1) KEY TAKEAWAYS • Medical debt is unique from other types of debt for its connection to health-related circumstances that individuals often cannot predict or control. • When medical bills go unpaid, they are often sold to debt collectors and can be reported to credit bureaus. • If reported to a credit bureau, debt can hurt a person’s credit score, which lenders, employers, utilities, and others use to gauge financial reliability. • Medical bills can also become debt when paid with loans, which may accrue higher costs than the original bill. Unpaid Medical Debt In Collections Bill Medical Visit Health ‘R Us or a debt collector or buyer may report the debt to a credit bureau. If not paid, the debt appears on Jessie’s credit history 180 days later. Jessie visits Health ‘R Us. Incurs medical expense not paid by insurance. Jessie does not pay Health ‘R Us. Bill Past Due Health ‘R Us seeks payment from Jessie directly or through a debt collector. Health ‘R Us considers the bill bad debt. Writes debt off as business loss. Health ‘R Us sells debt to a debt buyer, which seeks payment. Health ‘R Us continues to seek payment directly or through debt collector. Health ‘R Us warehouses the bad debt. Bad Debt Debt Sold Debt Collection Debt Held Credit Report ISSUE PRIMER Medical Debt 101 2 SycamoreInstituteTN.org The Path from Medical Bill to Medical Debt An unpaid medical bill follows the path to debt much like other types of bills (Figure 1). However, medical debt is unique among various types of debt for its connection to health-related circumstances that individuals often cannot predict or control (e.g. an accident, insurance claim denial, surprise medical bill). Unpaid Medical Bill If a person does not pay a medical bill, the health care provider attempts to collect the money either directly or through a contracted bill collector. Several unique features of the health care financing system contribute to medical bills going unpaid (see “The Unique Causes of Medical Debt”). Federal law requires certain steps by nonprofit hospitals and most federally-qualified health centers to determine a patient’s eligibility for financial assistance and how much they can be charged. (2) (3) (4) Bill Past Due The provider considers a bill past-due if the patient does not either pay it or arrange a payment plan. On average, hospitals and health care providers usually expect to receive payment within 90-180 days of billing a patient, but there is no defined amount of time that a provider must wait before considering a bill past due. (5) (6) (7) In 2017, Tennessee hospitals reported $1.5 billion of “bad debt” — i.e. past-due medical debt they considered a business loss. (6) To help offset these costs, some hospitals get supplemental payments from Medicare and the state’s Medicaid program, TennCare. (8) (9) Debt in Collections Providers can turn an unpaid bill over to in-house or third-party debt collectors or sell it to a debt buyer. Debt buyers usually purchase debts for a small fraction of the debt amount. Debt collectors and buyers typically seek payment with letters and phone calls and may charge penalties and interest. If the debt remains unpaid, however, they may also file civil lawsuits that can lead to outcomes like garnished wages or personal property seizure. (10) (11) Credit Scores An unpaid medical bill can be reported to credit bureaus at any point after the bill is issued. (7) If it is reported to a credit bureau and not paid within 180 days of that report, the debt appears on a credit report as an “account in collections.” (12) In 2014, medical debt accounted for 52% of all accounts in collections nationwide. (7) Not all unpaid medical bills or debts in collections are reported to credit bureaus. Collections accounts on an individual’s credit report hurt their credit score. If unpaid medical bills are reported to a credit bureau, that person’s credit score is reduced for seven years — even if they ultimately pay off the debt. (6) Consumers can improve their credit scores by making on-time payments for most debt types (e.g. a mortgage and credit cards). Credit bureaus do not track on-time medical bill payments, however, so medical bills can only reduce a person’s credit score. (13) (14) Lenders use credit to gauge an individual’s liabilities and the probability that they will pay their financial obligations. Credit scores can be a gateway or a barrier to financial stability and economic mobility: ISSUE PRIMER Medical Debt 101 3 SycamoreInstituteTN.org • Access to “Good” Debt — Lower credit scores can make it harder to access the types of loans and credit that can enhance economic mobility and long-term wealth (see text box). (15) (16) • The Cost of Debt — A good credit score allows people to qualify for loans with better interest rates. In August 2018, a person with good credit could have paid $3,000 less in interest on a $10,000 car loan than someone with a poor credit score. (17) • Employment Opportunities — Many employers check credit reports when making hiring and promotion decisions. (18) A 2017 national survey of employers found that over 30% checked credit history in making employment decisions. (19) • Housing Opportunities — Credit scores can determine a person’s ability to secure a mortgage as well as the terms of their loan. In addition, landlords often check potential tenants’ credit reports, and they may reject applicants for poor credit history or require a larger security deposit. (18) • The Cost of Transportation & Utilities — Credit history can also affect basic needs like transportation and utilities. Car loans can be more expensive or unattainable for those with poor credit, and utility companies (e.g. water, electricity, internet, cable) may require larger security deposits from new customers with poor credit. (18) • The Cost of Insurance — Credit history can also affect home, auto, and life insurance premiums. To protect Tennesseans, state law forbids insurers from considering medical debt for this purpose. (20) (21) Since 2017, medical debts in collections can be removed from credit reports if the insurer ultimately pays a disputed or overdue bill. (12) However, if the patient is ultimately responsible for any portion of the bill after a dispute is resolved, the debt remains on their credit history even if they pay it in full. GOOD vs. BAD DEBT Different types of debt are often described as being “good” or “bad.” The precise definitions of each category may depend on the source, but in general: • “Good” (i.e. secured) types of debt can help the borrower build wealth, earn more, or become more financially secure. Examples commonly include home mortgages, student loans, and small business loans. • “Bad” (i.e. unsecured, high-cost) types of debt are often associated with negative financial outcomes. Examples commonly include credit card debt, medical debt, car title loans, and payday loans. “Bad” debt for one person may not be “bad” debt for everyone. While credit card debt is usually considered “bad,” using a credit card responsibly can improve a person’s credit score and help them secure better loan terms in the future. On the other hand, if a person consistently maintains a high credit card balance and is unable to make payments, their credit score will suffer. (16) ISSUE PRIMER Medical Debt 101 4 SycamoreInstituteTN.org Medical debt does not always accurately reflect one’s will or ability to pay. (13) (22) A 2014 study by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that half of people with medical collections had an otherwise clean credit history. (23) One reason may be bills sent to collections for reasons other than willingness or ability to pay (see “The Unique Causes of Medical Debt”). As a result, some entities that evaluate credit information (e.g. credit bureaus, lenders, employers) now exclude medical collections when reviewing credit histories. (13) (22) However, excluding medical debt is not a required or widespread practice. Taking Loans to Pay Medical Bills Medical bills can also become debt when people take loans to pay them, often at higher cost. To pay their bills, people sometimes use credit cards, take out a second home mortgage, or turn to other higher-cost forms of credit. (15) (5) For example, a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation national survey found that 34% of people who reported problems paying medical bills increased credit card debt to help pay them. (24) In the 2015 National Financial Capability Study, an estimated 50% of Tennesseans with unpaid medical bills (compared to 23% without) reported taking a payday loan (i.e. a short-term, high-interest loan) in the last five years. (25) Interest and late fees that accrue from these financing mechanisms can sometimes cost more than the original bill. The Unique Causes of Medical Debt Medical debt is unique from other types of debt due to some of the ways in which people can end up with an unpaid medical bill — including the complexity of medical billing, third-party reimbursement process, and the unpredictable nature of health care costs. (23) (26) Unpredictable or Unaffordable Health Care Costs Health care needs are not always predictable. In the 2016 Kaiser survey, 66% of people who reported a problem paying medical bills attributed it to an unexpected, short-term medical expense like an accident. (24) Unexpected illness or injury can also reduce a family’s income and ability to pay for needed medical care. When unexpected illness strikes, the patient (and sometimes a family member/caretaker) may have to stop working or cut their hours. (5) People without health insurance are more likely to have unpaid medical bills, but cost-sharing and surprise bills mean insurance is not a cure-all. Most health insurance offers financial protection against catastrophic medical expenses. However, an insured person may still get bills they do not expect or cannot afford. These bills can reflect cost-sharing requirements (e.g. deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance), services not being covered, or providers being out-of-network. (27) (24) (28) (29) For example, a patient at an in-network hospital who unknowingly gets care from an out-of-network provider could receive an unexpected bill from that provider (also called a “balance bill”). (30) Almost every employer-sponsored insurance plan in Tennessee now requires a deductible, and the average family plan deductible has nearly tripled since 2002 (Figure 2). Almost half of Tennesseans got their health insurance plans through an employer in 2017. (31) That same year, 94% of employer plans in Tennessee required an out-of-pocket deductible — up from 60% in 2002. Over the same period, the average deductible for family coverage grew 2.8 times larger, after accounting for inflation. (32) (33) ISSUE PRIMER Medical Debt 101 5 SycamoreInstituteTN.org Figure 2. The Average Deductible for an Employer-Sponsored Family Plan in Tennessee Has Almost Tripled Since 2002 Dollar amounts have been adjusted for inflation using the CPI-U. Data for 2007 were not collected. Source: The Sycamore Institute’s analysis of data from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) (32) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (33) The price of health care services is not always clear. Patients are typically responsible for out-ofpocket costs not covered by insurance but often do not know the price of medical care before it is provided. (34) (35) The price of care can also depend on coverage. For example, insured consumers often pay based on rates negotiated by their insurer and the provider, while uninsured, self-paying consumers are often charged more. (36) Complexity of Medical Billing The complexities of medical billing also contribute to medical debt. The medical billing process involves complicated interactions between patients, health care providers, and insurance companies. Any confusion or error in those interactions can lead to unpaid bills. Billing errors and disputes between providers and insurers can result in unpaid medical bills. For example, one study found healthcare.gov Marketplace insurers in Tennessee denied between 8% and 23% of claims by in-network providers in 2017. (37) These disputes can delay or deny payment to providers for services provided to patients. Reasons that a claim may be denied include: • Billing mistakes — Insurers may not provide prompt payment to health care providers if the providers do not properly bill insurers. For example, a provider may fail to include required prior authorization paperwork or use the wrong billing codes. (26) • Medical necessity determinations — Insurance companies may deny a claim when they disagree with a health care provider about whether the service was medically necessary or appropriate. (13) Patients are often asked to pay disputed medical bills while insurers and providers attempt to resolve the dispute. If an individual does not pay the bill during this time, it can be turned over to collections. Before receiving medical care, most consumers sign consent forms agreeing that they are responsible for any medical bills their insurance company does not cover in full.

(26) (23) • Being unaware of a debt — Due to billing errors or miscommunication, consumers may not realize a bill is past-due or has been turned over to collections. (38) • Awaiting dispute resolution — Patients may choose not to pay their bill until after any billing errors or disputes have been resolved.
